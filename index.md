## Questions 
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic that I have comvered so far in my domain is the
analysis of the RMSProp optimizer. I specifically like that it uses an 
exponential moving average of the gradients as a proxy for 2nd order curvature 
for adapting the step size. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would potentially want to investigate the theoretical limit for sharpness of 
the RMSProp optimizer. That is, at what level of sharpness will the loss 
function start to diverge, and does it implicitly bias itself back to stability.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
There is not any significant change that I would make in this project. My Q1 and
Q2 problems are different and require different approaches, making them
uncomparable. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be potentially interested in exploring Stochastic Weight Averaging or 
Stochastic Gradient Descent as part of the RMSProp optimizer.
